# Trello project!

This is a project I made to mimic much of the basic functionality of Trello. As it stands, you can log in or sign up and then start creating boards. Those boards have lists and each of the lists can have cards added to them. You can drag and drop cards onto various lists and drag and drop cards around.

Software used:
Backend - rails
Frontend - backbone
